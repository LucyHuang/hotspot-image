        <p>With the National Sleep Foundation’s Sleep Awareness Week coming up in April, it is more evident than ever that Americans need more sleep. According to a report published by CDC in 2016, one in three America adults are not getting enough sleep.
            In a survey conducted by Statista in 2017, 20 percent of adults in the US said they go to bed after midnight and 36 percent wake up tired in the morning. Americans are also having difficulty falling asleep. Nineteen percent of Americans reported
            having difficulty unwinding in the evening.</p>

        <p>In a press release from the CDC, the director of the CDC’s Division of Population Health discusses about the benefits of sleep hygiene “Lifestyle changes such as going to bed at the same time each night; rising at the same time each morning; and
            turning off or removing televisions, computers, mobile devices from the bedroom, can help people get the healthy sleep they need” said Wayne Giles, M.D.</p>

        <p>“I use different sleep aids, herbal stuff,” said Joanna Madej “if it is intense then melatonin.” As the head of marketing communications for a tech company, Madej is used to running of five and half hours of sleep during stressful work weeks.
            Her sleep deprivation is exacerbated by jetlag. Like Madej, most Americans would love to have eight to nine hours of sleep. While getting more sleep seems almost impossible there are ways to improve your night’s sleep. Many studies have shown
            that simple changes in sleep hygiene can help you fall asleep faster and stay a sleep. Here are some ways to clean up your sleep hygiene:</p>
